## Design Document

This document is intended as an explanation of changes the mod implements and the status of each change. Specific numbers for each change will be filled in as the features are completed.

## I. A Hard Start

The game before the game. Starting with only one light mech and yourself as a pilot, you must build up your mercenary company from scratch. Imagine you're playing part of the three year interlude before the game even starts.  

This will not be an easy or forgiving part of your career, every mistake could cost you weeks of revenue in downtime. You will have to manage your resources very carefully to even make it to the first mission of the main campaign.

### [Planned] Start with only 1 mech and 1 pilot

Begin the game with only the mech from your background and yourself as a pilot.

### [Planned] Make starting background choice determine starting mech

### [Planned] Adjust starting funds, expenses, and equipment

Start the game with less than one months worth of cbills in the bank. Probably around two thirds of whatever one months cost is.

Starting equipment should be small but allow some flexibility. Probably 2 medium lasers and an SRM 2.

## II. Economy

### [Planned] Mech specific maintenance costs

Adjust monthly maintenance costs of all mechs to reflect their chassis, their relative maintainability according to lore, and their general usefulness in the game.

### [Planned] Higher repair and refit costs

Make armor addition and removal cost cbills
Make removing components take time if possible

### [Planned] Lower contract payments on campaign missions

The main campaign missions pay a little too much based on their difficulty. The cbill payments for these missions will probably be lowered slightly.

### [Planned] More economic affects from events

### [Planned] More scarcity in stores and higher prices in some systems

## III. Salvage

### [Planned] Change the salvage rules to be more granular and less forgiving

Require 8 parts to complete a mech.

A dead mech starts with 8 parts
-5 parts for a destroyed center torso
-2 parts for each leg
-1 part for head, arms, and side torsos

### [Planned] Friendly mechs that lose their CT will be lost and must be salvaged

Mechs that lose their center torso will be lost. Ejecting will allow you to save your mech in its current state minus its head.

### [Planned] Increase repair time for head internals

Increasing time to repair the head by a significant amount to simulate how difficult it is to fix a mech's cockpit.

### [Planned] Salvaged Mechs and Mechs removed from storage start completely destroyed

A mech must be fully 'assembled' in order to 

### [Planned] Only drop exactly what the enemy had equipped

No ++ weapons, cockpit mods, gyros, or targetting computers unless the enemy has them equipped.

### [Planned] Flatten tech point progression

Reduce the amount of potential tech points that can be gained throughout the game to keep repair times signficant. Max tech points achievable without considering crew should be around 10.

## IV. Combat

### [Planned] Less armor debuffed units

Make the game more quickly progress to fighting fully armored units with more regularity. The base armor values are already very low, the player doesn't need a discount.

No 25% armor units after 1 skull difficulty.
No 50% armor units after 1.5 skull difficulty.
No 25% armor units after 2 skull difficulty.

These values can be enforced with some variance so that they're not "set in stone" and you can still have a few surprises once in a while.

### [Planned] Rebalance accuracy

The weapons in the game are too accurate in general, which leads to lower time to kill.

1. Base accuracy must be slightly lowered
2. Medium range (+2 to hit) must be added to all weapons
3. Called shot effectiveness needs to be reduced
4. LRM's should not be able to make called shots (Implement by reducing their called shot deviation to their normal base value)
5. LRM accuracy general reduction in effectiveness +1-2 to hit.

### [Planned] Reduce bulwark effectiveness

Bulwark is too strong, and reducing accuracy will only make it that much better. It will probably be reduced to 25% effectiveness to make it equal to cover.

### [Planned] Rebalance evasion

Light mechs should have higher possible evasion, heavier mechs should have lower evasion. Possibly some amount of chassis dependent evasion if the game will allow it.

### [Planned] Rebalance lostech

Make lostech weapons more appealing and also allow them to have special variants. 

### [Research] Light mechs can fire after sprinting

This sounds like a really interesting idea, but needs to be researched. It would come with a heavy to hit penalty, probably at least +4.

## V. Map and Missions

### [Planned] More mission types

### [Planned] Mini campaign deployments to encourage depth of roster

## VI. Other Content

### [Planned] More mech and vehicle variants

Anything from 3025 that can be put into the game will be in the game. Possibly some much rarer star league variants as well.

### [Planned] More lostech content

More missions where lostech can be encountered and possibly salvaged as well as more presence in stores.

## VII. Retirement and new campaign creation
